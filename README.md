# ICA8-Test

## Description:

* We have to create a java program which find the maximum number of empty urinals such that no two urinals are togther. Here we can take the input in two ways. First simply from the keyboard input and second input can be from a file.
* The input is in the form of 0's and 1's where 0 means urinal is not occuiped and 1 means its occupied.
* Now given a string return maximum urinals that can be occupied. 
* Return -1 if there is already a mistake in the input string.

## Goal:

1. Create a _urinals.java_ file to create all logic about finding the no. of empty urinals from input string.
2. Create a _urinalsTest.java_ file to write all unit tests and handle exceptions.
